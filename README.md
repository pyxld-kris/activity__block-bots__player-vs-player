#### GOAL:

Program your Block Bot to defeat your opponent!

- GAME SUMMARY: Every .5 seconds, each Bot is able to make a movement if they are touching the ground. Each movement expends a certain amount of energy when made, defined by the code running the Bot. Higher energy used == bigger movement. A movement is either a jump or a dash. Bots gain a point when they jump on top of another Bot or when their opponent Bot runs out of energy. For each round, the first Bot to 3 points wins!

Use the "Activity Documentation" button to read more about all the different ways you can control your bot!
